         <div className="para">
             <h2>Uploading an Image</h2>
             <p>To upload an image of a resistor, follow these steps:</p>
             <p>a. Click on the "Upload Image" button located on the main page of the app.</p>
             <p>b. Select the image of the resistor from your computer's file system.</p>
             <p>c. process the image and determine the value of the resistor.</p>

             <h2>Using Your Computer's Camera</h2>
             <p>To capture an image of a resistor using your computer's camera, follow these steps:</p>
             <p>a. Click on the "Take a picture by Laptop" button located on the main page of the app.</p>
             <p>b. Allow the app to access your computer's camera when prompted.</p>
             <p>c. Hold the resistor up to the camera and adjust it until the resistor is in focus.</p>
             <p>d. Click on the "Capture" button to take a picture of the resistor.</p>
             <p>e. process the image and determine the value of the resistor.</p>
